# TWDU Europe
This repository contains the practical exercise of this TWDU training. It contains the following relevant modules:
* data-ingestion
* data-transformation
* data-analytics  
* data-streaming

## Quickstart
1. Set up your [Development Environment](./development-environment.md)
2. Set up your [AWS CLI](./aws.md)
3. Pick a team. Your team name is the combination of your first and last initials (`ab-cd-ef`). Run `./go setup-workflow <TEAMNAME>`. This will switch you to a new branch and will create a workflow in your branch (and auto-commits). You will work off this branch for the remainder of the practical exercise.
